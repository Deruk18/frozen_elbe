 GPR_politics.1.d:0 "Today, while on a walk near his home Ernst Thalmann was shot. Though he had his small guard unit with him, they were unable to react quick enough to the lone gunman, who appears to be connected to the illegitimate government that sits just beyond the Elbe. Only one shot was fired, and at first it seemed to be nothing but a minor wound with Thalmann reportedly laughing off the shot. However, a few seconds later, he collapsed and was rushed to a hospital where he was declared dead."
